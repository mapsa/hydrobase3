 1) You need the netCDF C libraries version 3.5 or later
    (Do NOT use version 3.4)
    
    A tar distribution from UCAR is included on this ftp site.
    Or go to web site: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html
    
    untar and build netcdf-3.5.0.tar.gz
    
    there is a README file in this UCAR distribution


 2) Create a directory for installing HydroBase (mkdir /usr/local/HydroBase3)
    This will be referred to as $HB_HOME 
    cd $HB_HOME/src 
    copy makefile.dist to makefile
    edit makefile with appropriate values for the following:

**************************************   
These lines must be edited: 
**************************************   
INCLUDE= .
NETCDFLIB = /usr/local/netcdf-3.6/lib
NETCDFINC = /usr/local/netcdf-3.6/include
BINDIR = ../bin
CC= gcc                     # invoke your C compiler
CFLAGS=-c -I$(INCLUDE)      # compile, include  
LINK= gcc
LDFLAGS = 		    # any linker flags
LIBS= -lm -lc               # math, c libs 
**************************************   


3)Edit hb_paths.h with correct path to the HydroBase3 /lib subdirectory
     where the topography file and gamma.nc file are stored   
     (i.e. $HB_HOME/lib). 
     
  4) create $BINDIR if it does not exist
     
     
  5) make and install:
  
  Type the following commands:
  
   make hydrobase
   make install
   make clean
   
   to add OPTIONAL modules:
   
   make other
   make install_other
   make clean_all
   
   
  6)  That's it.
